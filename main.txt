Ques:1
Kanika and Harshita are playing a coin game. They are given n coins with values x1, x2 …. xn where 'n' is always even. They take alternate terms. In each turn, a player picks either the first coin or the last coin from the row and removes it from the row. The value of coin is received by that player. Determine the maximum value that Piyush can win with if he moves first. Both the players play optimally.
Input Format
First line contains the number of coins 'n'.
Second line contains n space separated integers where ith index denotes the value of ith coin.
Constraints
1 < N <= 30, N is always even
0 <= Ai <= 1000000
Output Format
Print a single line with the maximum possible value that Kanika can win with.
Sample Input

1 2 3 4
Sample Output
6
Explanation
Kanika will pick the coin 4. Then Harshita can pick either 1 or 3. In both the cases Kanika picks coin 2 and wins with a total of 6.

Ques:3
You are given an N*M grid. Each cell (i,j) in the grid is either blocked, or empty. The rat can move from position (i,j), down or right on the grid.
Initially rat is on the position (1,1). It wants to reach position (N,M). Find the rightmost path through which, rat can reach this position. A path is rightmost, if the rat is at position (i,j), it will always move to (i,j+1), if there exists a path from (i,j+1) to (N,M).
Input Format
First line contains 2 integers, N and M, denoting the rows and columns in the grid. Next N line contains. M characters each. An 'X' in position (i,j) denotes that the cell is blocked and ans 'O' denotes that the cell is empty.
Constraints
1<=N,M<=1000 GRID(i,j)='X' or 'O'
Output Format
If a solution exists: Print N lines, containing M integers each. A 1 at a position (i,j) denotes that the (i,j)th cell is covered in the path and a 0 denotes that the cell is not covered in the path.
If solution doesn't exist, just print "-1".

Ques:5
This year when Students visited DCE for DRONTECH 2019. He and GOPI started discussing few problems on divide and conquer. Student asked GOPI that if you have 2 strings s1 and s2 can you find if they are equivalent. GOPI then asked the condition for being equivalent to which student replied
Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:
They are equal.
If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct:
a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2
a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1
GOPI quickly solved the problem can you?
Input Format
First line is number of test cases t Then follow two strings each of same length
Constraints
1 <= test cases <= 10 1 <= string length <= 50000
Output Format
print "YES" if they are "equivalent" and "NO" if they are not
Sample Input
3
ababa
baaba
ab
ba
abc
abc
Sample Output
NO
YES
YES
Explanation
test case 1 : - you cannot split the string into two halves of same size and s1 != s2 hence they are not same test case 2 :- split ab as a and b and ba as b and a then condition is fulfilled test case 3 :- they are already same


Ques:6
Given n friends, each one can remain single or can be paired up with some other friend. Each friend can be paired only once. Find out the total number of ways in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.
Input Format
First line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. Next t lines contain an integer n each.
Constraints
1<= n < 30
Output Format
Output t lines each line describing the answer.
Sample Input
1
3
Sample Output
4
Explanation
{1}, {2}, {3} : all single {1}, {2,3} : 2 and 3 paired but 1 is single. {1,2}, {3} : 1 and 2 are paired but 3 is single. {1,3}, {2} : 1 and 3 are paired but 2 is single. Note that {1,2} and {2,1} are considered same.

Ques:7
Given a string containing duplicates, print all its distinct permutations such that there are no duplicate permutations and all permutations are printed in a lexicographic order.
Input Format
The first and only line of the test case contains the input string.
Constraints
Length of the string <= 8
Output Format
Print all the distinct permutations in a lexicographic order such that each permutation is in a new line. Note that there should not be any duplicate permutations.
Sample Input
ABA
Sample Output
AAB

BAA
Explanation
The possible permutations for the given string are { "AAB" , "AAB" , "ABA" , "BAA" } . We skip the repeating "AAB" permutation and only print it in once. Also we print the final output in lexicographical order.

Ques:10
Yash loves to play number games with his friend Harsh. One day they were playing a game where one of them will speak out a positive number and the other have to tell the sum of its factors. The first one to say it correctly wins. After a while they got bored and wanted to try out a different game. Yash then suggested about trying the reverse. That is, given a positive number 'S' , they have to find a number whose factors add up to 'S'. Realizing that this task is tougher than the original task, Yash came to you for help. Luckily Yash owns a portable programmable device and you have decided to burn a program to this device. Given the value of 'S' as input to the program, it will output a number whose sum of factors equal to 'S' .
Input Format
There are several cases . Each case of input will consist of a positive integer 'S'<= 100000 . The last case is followed by a value of 0 .
Constraints
0 < S <= 10000
Output Format
print the integer whose factors sum is equal to 'S'. Print the largest Integer whose factors sum is 'S' . If no such number exists, output '-1' .
